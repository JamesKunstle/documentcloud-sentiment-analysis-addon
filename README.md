# DocumentCloud Sentiment Analysis Add-on 
 
It can be useful to know what the tone of a document is.
Generally speaking, the smallest unit of tone (i.e. non-explicit 
expressions of opinion or of intention) one normally notices is 
at the sentence level.

This add-on breaks apart the input documents into their respective
individual sentences and runs sentiment analysis on each of these 
sentences. It outputs the document name, the sentence number,and
the identified (sentiment, valence) rating. 

This is a computationally heavy task so it is recommended that the 
add-on generally be run on smaller and fewer documents if possible.
